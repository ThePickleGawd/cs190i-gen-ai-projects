[Verse 1]
You got a lot of things to prove
I got too much on my conscience to hide
I'ma make a ton of money for some of the niggas who won't be coming back
Yeah, it's a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad day
You should've never let me walk through that door
You should've never let me leave that hotel
You should've never let me touch my toes
Fuck what he thought
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
I'm not sure I'm ready to let him go
I need him back
You don't deserve him
What you gonna do with your heartbreak? (Oh no, no)
You don't deserve him, oh no, no
I'm not sure I'm ready to let him go (Oh no, no, no)
What you gonna do with your heartbreak?
I need him back, I need him back

[Chorus]
It's a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad day
You should've never let me walk through that door
You should've never let me leave that hotel
You should've never let me touch my toes
Fuck what he thought
