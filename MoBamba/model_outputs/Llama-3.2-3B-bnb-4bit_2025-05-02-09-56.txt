[Verse 1]
Oh my God, I'm so tired of talkin'
All my friends got they names on they accounts
I swear I'ma fuck her if I never see that bitch again
I know you know, we don't need no introduction
You get to fuckin' with me, you get a free car
If you let me get in your ass, you're my next target
I'm the type of nigga to give the bitch a fuckin' heart
I was just talkin', you know, and I was just playin'
I had my hand up on her ass, it was just the way she was
When she looked back, she ain't talkin' 'bout the shit I was sayin'
And that's why I'ma hit that bitch one more time before I go, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You know how I get, I get in my bag, I get in my bag
And I ain't with this no more, I want all of that ass, I want all of that ass
All of that ass, all of that ass
I'ma get all of that ass, all of that ass
I'ma get all of that ass, all of that ass
I'ma get all of that ass, all of that ass

[Chorus]
Fuck me good 'cause I know you don't do that shit, no
When we go deep, I promise you won't need no condom
I'm goin' crazy in the cut
You see how I fuck 'cause nobody do that shit, no
When we go deep, I promise you won't need no condom
I'm goin' crazy in the cut
You see how I fuck 'cause nobody do that shit, no
When we go deep, I promise you won't need no condom

[Verse 2]
Oh my God, it's been a long night
She want me to put that thing in her face, it's so lit
She ain't ask for no condoms, she ain't scared
I'ma hit that pussy like I'm in the NBA
I know we done this, we gon' have to do it again
She ain't even worried 'bout her period, I told her I'm on birth control
I told her, "Baby, don't you fuck with no bitches, don't you fuck with no bitches
I'm a real one, real nigga with a real dick, fuck you want?
Yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one

[Chorus]
Fuck me good 'cause I know you don't do that shit, no
When we go deep, I promise you won't need no condom
I'm goin' crazy in the cut
You see how I fuck 'cause nobody do that shit, no
When we go deep, I promise you won't need no condom
I'm goin' crazy in the cut
You see how I fuck 'cause nobody do that shit, no
When we go deep, I promise you won't need no condom

[Verse 3]
I'ma do this, I'ma do that, I'ma make her scream my name
I'ma make her scream my name, I'ma make her scream my name
I'ma make her scream my name, I'ma make her scream my name
