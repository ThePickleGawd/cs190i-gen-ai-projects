[Verse 1]
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
What's in the dark, oh my God
I see you all and I'm okay
I'm okay
I'm okay, I'm okay

[Pre-Chorus]
I think my eyes are bleeding
So why don't we make it last forever?
What if I stay, what if I stay?

[Chorus]
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever

[Verse 2]
I need your love to last forever
I can feel the stars falling down
I can feel your heart, baby
I can feel you in my mouth
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever

[Bridge]
Can't let you go, I can't let you go
I can't let you go, I can't let you go
Can't let you go, I can't let you go
I can't let you go, I can't let you go
Can't let you go, I can't let you go
I can't let you go, I can't let you go

[Chorus]
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
I need your love to last forever
