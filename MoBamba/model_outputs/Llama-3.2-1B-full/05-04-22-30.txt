[Verse 1]
Bougie, he be on that bullshit again
I be thinkin' it's time to fuck up the room
It's been a minute since I had to bust a nut
But I'm right back on that bullshit
Like I had been, and I had been, and I had been
Like I had been, and I had been, and I had been
Like I had been, and I had been, and I had been
Like I had been, and I had been, and I had been

[Chorus]
He like a tall, skinny bitch with a little bit of curvy
With her legs wrapped around his waist and her ass curved
He think he a creep, I think he's just a fan
'Cause I be walkin' past him, he just there to watch me
Then I'm onto something else, I'm like, fuck it, I don't wanna talk about it
Or maybe I'm off that D'usse, I'm just off that Act'
I'm just off that Act', like

[Verse 2]
He be actin' like he ain't ever seen a white person before
Well, if he ever been to Texas, I bet he's a fool for that
Because I am the biggest black man in the South
I'm just a little smaller than those from Texas
But he actin' like he ain't ever seen a white person before
Well, if he ever been to Texas, I bet he's a fool for that
Because I am the biggest black man in the South
I'm just a little smaller than those from Texas
But he actin' like he ain't ever seen a white person before
Well, if he ever been to Texas, I bet he's a fool for that
Because I am the biggest black man in the South
I'm just a little smaller than those from Texas
