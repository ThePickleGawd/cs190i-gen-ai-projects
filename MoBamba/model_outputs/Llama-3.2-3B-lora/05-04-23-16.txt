[Verse 1]
What you know about me? (Huh?)
The kid from the bottom? (Who?)
I'm a real life, real life, real life
The story of a young nigga who killed
A couple bitches, but not no sex
So he's a G but not no L
The way he ball, got his foot in two teams
Bitches think he's gay, but his foot in too
When he hit you, he don't give no licks
He's straight to the head like no kicks
Niggas said he won't go in, but he gon' do it
Then he went in, but he gon' do it
Gotta know that I'm the best in the game like
I'm the G.O.A.T. like I'm the G.O.A.T. like
I'm the G.O.A.T. like I'm the G.O.A.T. like
I'm the G.O.A.T. like I'm the G.O.A.T. like

[Verse 2]
Now what you know about me? (Huh?)
I'm a real life, real life, real life
A young nigga who's killing, got a gun in the house
Heard he be dealing weed, I swear it's true
He's straight up to the head like no kick
Gotta know that I'm the best in the game like
I'm the G.O.A.T. like I'm the G.O.A.T. like
I'm the G.O.A.T. like I'm the G.O.A.T. like
I'm the G.O.A.T. like I'm the G.O.A.T. like

[Chorus]
I ain't gon' lose, I'ma win, you're gon' lose
You gon' lose, you're gon' lose
I ain't gon' lose, I'ma win, you're gon' lose
You're gon' lose, you're gon' lose

You're gon' lose, you're gon' lose

You're gon' lose, you're gon' lose

[Verse 3]
They be asking me who the real is, nigga
Who the real is, nigga, who the real is?
Gotta know I'm the GOAT like I'm the GOAT like I'm the GOAT like I'm the GOAT like
Gotta know I'm the GOAT like I'm the GOAT like I'm the GOAT like I'm the GOAT like
