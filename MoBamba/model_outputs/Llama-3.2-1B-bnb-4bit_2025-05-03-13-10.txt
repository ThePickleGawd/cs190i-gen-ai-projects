[Verse 1]
I don't know if you heard, they tried to lock me up
But the police don't know who they talking with
I'm just trying to keep it real
I know you're worried, I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
Oh, you're worried, I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
Oh, you're worried, I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing

[Pre-Chorus]
How you doing? How you doing?
How you doing? How you doing?
How you doing? How you doing?
How you doing? How you doing?

[Chorus]
I'm not doing alright
You can't believe me
It's too dark to see
And you're too blinded
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?

[Verse 2]
But you don't know how they doing
I don't know how you're doing
How are you doing?
I don't know how you're doing
You don't know how they're doing
I don't know how they're doing
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?

[Bridge]
I've been so sick
You probably don't even know how I'm doing
I feel like I'm on the verge of passing out
I'm on the verge of passing out
Oh, you're worried, I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
Oh, you're worried, I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing
I guess I don't know how they doing

[Chorus]
I'm not doing alright
You can't believe me
It's too dark to see
And you're too blinded
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?

[Outro]
I'm not doing alright
You can't believe me
It's too dark to see
And you're too blinded
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
