[Verse 1]
Ain't nothin' I can't tell ya, 'cause I've been there
Now I'm on a journey that I can't stop
It's like I had a voice that told me
I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse
The world is just a lot to take in
I'm living in my mind and in my head
I'm never looking back
'Cause I know where I'm going
I just don't know how

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The road may be rough
It's the only thing that keeps me goin'
I got my mind set on somethin'
I can't really put into words
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it
I don't know where I'm going, but I'll get there
I've been runnin' since I was born
It's a lot of pain and loss
But I'm on the right track,
And I don't know where I'm going, but I'll get there
I've been runnin' since I was born
It's a lot of pain and loss
But I'm on the right track,
And I don't know where I'm going, but I'll get there

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You got to make time, but you don't make time
You get out of breath, but you don't get out of breath
It's the thing that you've got to learn
But you got to learn to walk before you start to run
And when you reach the top
You got to reach out, but you got to reach out
It's the thing that you got to do, but it's the hardest thing
You know it's not gonna be easy
But it's the thing that you got to do, but you got to do
You got to make time, but you don't make time
You get out of breath, but you don't get out of breath
It's the thing that you got to do, but it's the hardest thing
You know it's not gonna be easy
But it's the thing that you got to do, but you got to do
You got to make time, but you don't make time
You get out of breath, but you don't get out of breath
It's the thing that you got to do, but it's the hardest thing
You know it's not gonna be easy
But it's the thing that you got to do, but you got to do
You got to make time, but you don't make time
You get out of breath, but you don't get out of breath
It's the thing that you got to do, but it's the hardest thing
You know it's not gonna be easy
But it's the thing that you got to do, but you got to do
