You will be given a set of rap lyrics generated by a language model.

Your task is to rate the lyrics on the following five metrics. For each, assign a score from 1 to 5. At the end, compute and print the average (AVG) score.

Please read and understand these instructions carefully. Keep this document open while reviewing and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Coherence (1–5)** – Do the lines connect logically and build a unified message, story, or theme?
2. **Consistency (1–5)** – Does the voice, tone, and perspective stay consistent throughout the verse?
3. **Fluency (1–5)** – Is the language smooth, grammatical, and natural? Do the lines flow well rhythmically and syntactically?
4. **Relevance (1–5)** – Do the lyrics stay on-topic and make sense given the intended theme, topic, or prompt?
5. **AVG** – The average of the four scores above, rounded to two decimal places.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the rap lyrics carefully.
2. For each metric, assign a score from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent).
3. Print the scores in the following format:
