[Verse 1]
I don't do that shit that they do in the cut
I take 'em to the club, get 'em out
Tell 'em "Hey," when I see 'em out
Don't know who they are, then they shout
Gucci bag and I'm movin' with the crew
I don't know where I'm at, no time for no hoes
I'm tryna blow up
Tryna get out the hood
I'm tryna get out the hood, damn

[Pre-Chorus]
So many things to get, so many dreams to chase
So many nights, so many days to waste
I never think about the past or the future
I think about me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me

[Chorus]
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
I'm me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me

[Verse 2]
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
