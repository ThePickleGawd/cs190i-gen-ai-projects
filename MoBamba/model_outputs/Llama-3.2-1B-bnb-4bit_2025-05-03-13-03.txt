[Verse 1]
I'ma go back to the days where I didn't play with no drugs
I remember when you were a kid and you used to play with no toys
But you grew up in the streets, but you didn't grow up with no toys
I remember when you was living with the streets
You couldn't even imagine what was on the other side
You couldn't see your sister
I remember when you was living with the streets
You couldn't even imagine what was on the other side
You couldn't see your sister
I remember when you was living with the streets
You couldn't even imagine what was on the other side
You couldn't see your sister
And I remember when you was living with the streets
You couldn't even imagine what was on the other side
You couldn't see your sister

[Chorus]
I remember when you was living with the streets
You couldn't even imagine what was on the other side
You couldn't see your sister
I remember when you was living with the streets
You couldn't even imagine what was on the other side
You couldn't see your sister

You couldn't see your sister
I remember when you was living with the streets
You couldn't even imagine the other side
You couldn't see your sister
