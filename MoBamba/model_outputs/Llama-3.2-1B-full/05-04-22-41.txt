[Verse 1]
Nowadays, everybody wanna tell me what I should do
Instead of listenin' to what God has me for, e'rybody wanna tell me what I should do
What I should do, how can I be homophobic? (Oh, no)
Homophobic? Homonazi? You hate me? (Oh, no, no, no)
You hate me? What I should do?
'Cause I'm a gay rights activist
That's why everybody's gotta say somethin'
Well, if they're gonna say somethin', then it better be somethin'
Fuck the fame and fuck the hoes, let's talk about the things
That I'm praisin' (Fuck the fame and fuck the hoes)
That I ain't doin' (Nah, fuck the fame and fuck the hoes)
'Cause I ain't doin' shit (Nah, fuck the fame and fuck the hoes)
I was in the kitchen (Fuck the fame and fuck the hoes)
Bustin' them bitches (Fuck the fame and fuck the hoes)
In a rush (Fuck the fame and fuck the hoes)
Like a rush (Fuck the fame and fuck the hoes)

[Chorus]
And I won't lie
It's been a long road
Somebody gotta lay down the stones
The law can get in my way
But I keep knockin' it back
I know the force when I'm pushin' it back
I know the force when I'm pushin' it back
If I knew the past, I'd do better with it
I been on this since day one
Nigga, we don't go back and forth on the regular
I know it's been a long road
I know it's been a long road
I know somebody gotta lay down the stones
The law can get in my way
But I keep knockin' it back
I know the force when I'm pushin' it back
I know the force when I'm pushin' it back
If I knew the past, I'd do better with it

[Verse 2]
