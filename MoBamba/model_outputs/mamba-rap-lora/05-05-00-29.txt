[Verse 1]
I see the sun, but can't get high
Weed on me, I know it stings
It feels like a hundred miles an hour
And I don't feel a thing, you know
And I'm so high up in the sky
It's hard for me to come down

[Chorus]
Barely ever been in this condition
And I don't wanna come down
(I've been thinking of the stars
'Cause the stars are the most beautiful thing)
(Oh no)

[Verse 2]
I've been thinking of the stars
'Cause the stars are the most beautiful thing
Oh, I've been thinking of the stars
(Barely ever been in this condition)
Oh, I've been thinking of the stars
Oh, I've been thinking of the stars
Oh, I've been thinking of the stars
Oh, I've been thinking of the stars (The stars are the most beautiful thing)
Oh, I've been thinking of the stars (Barely ever been in this condition)
Oh, I've been thinking of the stars (Oh, I've been thinking of the stars)
Oh, I've been thinking of the stars (Barely ever been in this condition)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, my stars
I am the sun, the light, the stars
My stars
I have been thinking of the stars
They are the most beautiful thing

[Pre-Chorus]
(I've been thinking of the stars)
I've been thinking of the stars

I've been thinking of the stars
(Oh no)
