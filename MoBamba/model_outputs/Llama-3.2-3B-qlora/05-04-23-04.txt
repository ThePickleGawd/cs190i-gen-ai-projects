[Verse 1]
You got that body, it's beautiful
You know it, and I know it, I just don't know you
I'm at your place with no place to stay
And I can feel the way you treat me, I know
I'm tryna give you my all, but I can't give you it
I don't wanna be selfish, but I can't share it
I know it's not a problem, I'm aware it
I'm a fool for wanting it and I'm a fool for taking it
And I know it's hard to take it, but I hope you do
I know it's not much, but you deserve the truth
And I know I'm a fool for doing what I'm doing
But I hope you know it's worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna share you, I don't wanna share you (Hey)
But I know you want this, so I can't just keep it from you (Hey)
So here's the truth, you're worth it, I can't pretend it (Hey)
So I'm just gonna show you what I have in store for you

[Chorus]
Now, baby, I'm not tryna share you
I'm just scared to lose you, you got me on edge
You got me on edge
I'm on edge
When I get close to you, you're on my mind
You're on my mind
I'm in the room alone
I can't even touch you, 'cause I'm afraid you won't stay
I know it's selfish, but I can't change, I gotta stay
I gotta stay

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna share you, I don't wanna share you
I'm tryna take you, I don't wanna share you
It's just me and you, I know you're feeling what I feel
I know it, so I know you deserve to feel it
And if I could, I would give the world to you
I could, I would give the world to you
But you're worth more, you deserve more
And I know it, but I can't give it to you
You might have the world, but you're still a fool for me
I might have the world, but you're still a fool for me
If I gave you the world, would you still love me?
But you deserve the world
You deserve the world, you deserve the world
I know it's selfish, but you're worth it
And you're worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna share you, I don't wanna share you
But I know you want this, so I can't just keep it from you
So here's the truth, you're worth it, I can't pretend it
So I'm just gonna show you what I have in store for you
Now, baby, I'm not tryna share you
I'm just scared to lose you, you got me on edge
You got me on edge
I'm on edge
When I get close to you, you're on my mind
You're on my mind
I'm in the room alone
I can't even touch you, 'cause I'm afraid you won't stay
I know it's selfish, but I can't change, I gotta stay
I gotta stay
