```
[Verse 1]
So I don't really trust ya, can't take a chance
I know all you really wanna do is get in my pants
But I'm a player and I've been hurt before
And I don't really wanna get involved in a love for more
The way that you're lookin' and you're feelin'
And it's nothin' to me, oh, nothin' to me
