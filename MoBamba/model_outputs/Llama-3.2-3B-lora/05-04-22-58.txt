[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be the man that your man man
I don't wanna be the man that your man man
I don't wanna be the man that your man man
You know I'm the man you were meant to be with
And now I'm tryna break down the wall that you've been keeping
'Cause you were so young when we met and it's complicated
Now I'm tryna make it work, I'm tryna get it together
And you're still tryna get your shit together
You said, "Baby, when we first met
You said, "Baby, when we first met
I wasn't ready for the man I met
I wasn't ready for the man I met"
Baby, I think you're right
But we ain't got a choice, it's too late
I can't get you out of my head
I need you to get your shit together

[Chorus]
You know I'm just a man
You know I'm just a man
You know I'm just a man
That's so in love with you
You know I'm just a man
You know I'm just a man
You know I'm just a man
That's so in love with you
Baby, I think you're right
But we ain't got a choice, it's too late
I can't get you out of my head
Baby, I think you're right
But we ain't got a choice, it's too late
I can't get you out of my head

[Verse 2]
You know you're a woman
You know you're a woman
You know you're a woman
That I need to be with
You're a woman, I'm a man
And I know you're better than me
I know you're better than me
But I can't help the way that I feel
And it won't change no matter what you do
And it's never too late
We could leave now, you could say you're done with me
But we ain't got a choice, it's too late
I can't get you out of my head

[Chorus]
You know I'm just a man
You know I'm just a man
You know I'm just a man
That's so in love with you
You know I'm just a man
You know I'm just a man
You know I'm just a man
That's so in love with you
Baby, I think you're right
But we ain't got a choice, it's too late
I can't get you out of my head
Baby, I think you're right
But we ain't got a choice, it's too late
I can't get you out of my head
