[Verse 1]
I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do
Fuck, I'm all alone and I don't know what I should do
You say it's all over, don't try and make me
If you was a man you'd know that you can't make me
And it's all over, don't try and make me
If you was a man, you'd know that you can't make me
And it's all over, I'm on my own
I gotta be alone now
Gotta be alone now
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
Gotta be alone now

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the night is over, there's nothing left to say
But I can't help myself from tryna let you know
And I don't know what to do about it
And it's all over, don't try and make me
And it's all over, don't try and make me
If you was a man you'd know that you can't make me

[Chorus]
Gotta be alone now
Gotta be alone now
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
Gotta be alone now

[Verse 2]
She said, "Fuck it", she said, "Fuck it"
She said, "Fuck it", she said, "Fuck it"
But we are what we are
So what can I do now
If I was a man I'd know what to do now
If I was a man I'd know what to do now
Gotta be alone now
Gotta be alone now
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
Gotta be alone now

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the night is over, there's nothing left to say
But I can't help myself from tryna let you know
And I don't know what to do about it
And it's all over, don't try and make me
And it's all over, don't try and make me
If you was a man you'd know that you can't make me

[Chorus]
Gotta be alone now
Gotta be alone now
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
Gotta be alone now

[Outro]
Gotta be alone now, alone now
Gotta be alone now, alone now
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
Gotta be alone now
