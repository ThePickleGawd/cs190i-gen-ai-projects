I feel you inside my bones.
I feel you inside my bones
I can't forget you, I can't forget you
I'm lost for words
I can't get my heart
I feel you inside my bones

This love is so fresh
I don't want it to end
This love is so fresh
I don't want it to end
I can't get my heart
I feel you inside my bones
I can't forget you
I can't forget you
I feel you inside my bones

When I'm with you, I'm always with you
When I'm with you, I'm always with you
When I'm with you, I'm always with you
When I'm with you, I'm always with you
