[Verse 1]
It's the baddest selection
Pick and choose, I mean, I really got a lot
Of girls that's attractive, what can I do?
I try to be all that I can
Be a leader, I try to be all that I can
Be a fighter, I try to be all that I can
Be a world leader, I try to be all that I can
I'm the one that got the vision
I'm the one that got the vision
I'm the one that got the vision
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, I got what you wanted
I just gotta make sure that you understand
If it's anything that you want, you can have it
Just as long as you understand that I'm baddest

[Chorus]
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one

[Verse 2]
You know, people ask, "Who is the best?"
I mean, it's a tie between me and SEX
So, I'ma let SEX answer that
Sexy outfit and I'm showing my thong
You know, it's a tie between me and SEX
So, I'ma let SEX answer that
Sexy outfit and I'm showing my thong

[Interlude]
This is the part where I tell you I'm the best
But I'm the best at what I don't do
Like, the best at what I don't do
Is trust women

[Verse 3]
I try to be all that I can
I'm the one that got the vision
You know, people ask, "Is Halle Berry the best?"
I tell them, "Halle Berry is the best"
You see, people ask, "Is SEX the best?"
Well, if SEX is the best, then I'm the best
'Cause I'm the best at what I don't do
Like, the best at what I don't do
Is trust women
You see, people ask, "Is SEX the best?"
Well, if SEX is the best, then I'm the best
Like, the best at what I don't do
Like, the best at what I don't do
Is trust women

[Outro]
Okay, I got what you wanted
I just gotta make sure that you understand
If it's anything that you want, you can have it
Just as long as you understand that I'm baddest
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
