[Verse 1]
Man, I'm the only one who's actually doing it (Who's actually doing it)
If you were to ask me what I'm really into (What I'm really into)
I would not lie, it's a lot of different things
Some of it's outta your league (Outta your league), some of it's downright scary
So what I'm really into is the feeling that I'm the reason they talk to me
I just don't do nothing special, but I know that's what they all looking for
I'm a very, very special person (Special)
But I'll tell you something, I don't believe in fate
I believe in time, and the universe is just a metaphor for the way we feel
And you're the one I really wanna get to know (Oh, oh)
I'm not saying I'll take the time (Yeah)
To be the one who's really gonna be with you
But I swear it's only a matter of time

[Chorus]
It's a feeling like a cloud
That's moving in the sky
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right

[Verse 2]
I think I love the feeling of being the center of attention
I'm just a girl who's looking for attention (Oh, oh, oh)
I mean, I got a little thing for the feeling of the company (Oh, oh, oh)
And the feeling of the company makes me feel the feeling of the company
And the feeling of the company makes me feel the feeling of the company
And the feeling of the company makes me feel the feeling of the company (Feel the feeling of the company)
And the feeling of the company makes me feel the feeling of the company (Feel the feeling of the company)
And the feeling of the company makes me feel the feeling of the company

[Chorus]
It's a feeling like a cloud
That's moving in the sky
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right

[Verse 3]
But I'm a very special person
You see, it's not about the fame
It's about the feeling of being the one that got it
And I feel very special
And if you don't believe me, ask the others
They'll tell you, oh, I feel very special
And it's true, and I believe it
So I'm the only one
I'm the only one who's really into the feeling
I'm the only one
I'm the only one who's really gonna be with you
I'm the only one who's really into the feeling
I'm the only one

[Chorus]
It's a feeling like a cloud
That's moving in the sky
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right

[Verse 4]
I know you're the one that's really into the feeling (Yeah)
But it's just a feeling (Yeah)
I got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)
I feel special (Feel special)
Like I'm one of a kind (Like I'm one of a kind)
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right

[Chorus]
It's a feeling like a cloud
That's moving in the sky
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right

[Verse 5]
I'm just saying that I'm the only one who's really into the feeling (Yeah)
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right
I'm just saying that I'm the only one who's really into the feeling (Yeah)
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right

[Verse 6]
And the feeling that I'm the only one who's really into the feeling (Yeah)
I'm the only one who's really into the feeling (Yeah)
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right
And the feeling that I'm the only one who's really into the feeling (Yeah)
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right
And the feeling that I'm the only one who's really into the feeling (Yeah)
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right

[Outro]
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right

[Chorus]
It's a feeling like a cloud
That's moving in the sky
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right (I don't)

[Outro]
And I don't feel right without you, I don't feel right
I don't feel right (I don't feel right)
