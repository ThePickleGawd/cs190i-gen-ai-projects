[Verse 1]
Well I'm gonna break it all down, down down
And I'm gonna take it back, back to where it all started
Well I'm gonna let you know, know the truth, the truth
And I'm gonna take a stand, stand for what I believe in
If it was up to me, to me
I'd be on my way (I'd be on my way)
Cause we're all different, different (we're all different)
If I could change the world, I'd change the world
I'd change the world (I'd change the world)
I'd change the world, (I'd change the world)
If I could change the world, I'd change the world
Verse 2]
And it's all about what you believe in
And what you stand for, stand for
When you're on your knees, (when you're on your knees)
You're all alone, alone, (you're all alone)
When you're on your own (when you're on your own)
And it's all about what you believe in
And what you stand for, stand for
[Verse 1]
Well I'm gonna break it all down, down down

Well I'm gonna let you know, know the truth, the truth

If it was up to me, to me
I'd be on my way (I'd be on my way)
Cause we're all different, different (we're all different)
If I could change the world, I'd change the world
I'd change the world (I'd change the world)
I'd change the world, (I'd change the world)
If I could change the world, I'd change the world
Verse 2]
And it's all about what you believe in
And what you stand for, stand for
When you're on your knees, (when you're on your knees)
You're all alone, alone, (you're all alone)
When you're on your own (when you're on your own)
And it's all about what you believe in
And what you stand for, stand for
