[Verse 1]
Oh, but I want to be you
I wanna be your friend
You say "don't get too close"
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying so hard
To get through this
'Cause we got some things we gotta get through
[Verse 2]
We got a long way to go, baby
You're such a strong and independent woman
Now you don't need nobody
No you don't need nobody
[Chorus]
Oh, but I want to be you
I wanna be your friend
You say "don't get too close"
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying so hard
To get through this
'Cause we got some things we gotta get through
You're the queen of the universe
I'm just a little girl
[Chorus]
Oh, but I want to be you
I wanna be your friend
You say "don't get too close"
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying so hard
To get through this
'Cause we got some things we gotta get through
You're the queen of the universe
I'm just a little girl
[Chorus]
Oh, but I want to be you
I wanna be your friend
You say "don't get too close"
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying so hard
To get through this
'Cause we got some things we gotta get through
You're the queen of the universe
I'm just a little girl
