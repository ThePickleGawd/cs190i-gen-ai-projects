[Verse 1]
Hahah, you was lookin' like a fool
I was on the road, I was on the road
And you was stuck in the town
You would be in the booth
We would never come out
Now I'ma tell you the truth
You was lyin', you was lyin' and you was lyin' on me
You was lyin', you was lyin' on me
You was lyin', you was lyin' on me
You was lyin', you was lyin' on me
You was lyin', you was lyin' on me
You was lyin', you was lyin' on me

[Chorus]
Lyrical, lyrical, lyrical, lyrical
Lyrical, lyrical, lyrical, lyrical
Lyrical, lyrical, lyrical, lyrical
Lyrical, lyrical, lyrical, lyrical

[Verse 2]
They be lyin', they be lyin' like they never met us
I was in the cut like I never slept you
It's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat
It's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat
It's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat
It's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat
They be lyin', they be lyin' like they never met us
I was in the cut like I never slept you
It's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat
It's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat
It's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat
It's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat, it's a cutthroat
They be lyin', they be lyin' like they never met us
I was in the cut like I never slept you

[Verse 3]
She said she met me in the cut
I said "What's your name?" She said "Said your name"
I said "What you call me?" She said "I won't say"
She said "You better call me," I said "I won't say"
She said "Call me what's your name," I said "I won't say"
She said "Call me what's your name," I said "I won't say"
I said "Call me what's your name," I said "I won't say"
I said "Call me what's your name," I said "I won't say"

You be lyin' like you never met us
