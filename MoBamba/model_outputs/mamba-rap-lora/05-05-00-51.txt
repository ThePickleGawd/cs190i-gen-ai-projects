[Verse 1]
I'm out the hood and I'm on my way to win (Win)
Ain't no such thing as a gangster or a thuggin' nigga (Thug)
I don't even like the same type of music (Music)
All my niggas from the hood, they ain't no gangsters
I don't give a fuck 'bout no murder beefs
Niggas can't do me no wrong, I'm the one to beat (Beat)
I'm on my way to the top, I ain't no slacker (Slacker)
I'm a dog, I can't say how a dog treat (Treat)
Bust a nigga ass for the money, that's what it is (Shit)
We don't play with them clowns, them clowns can't make us laugh
Gotta get the cash, we get the cash, we don't play with that
We just want the realest gangsters that's what we're looking for
It ain't no one who's on the same level as us, we on that
We don't fuck around, we don't fuck around
We don't fuck around, we don't fuck around

[Chorus]
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)

You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)

[Verse 2]
Fuck with me, you can't do it (Nah)
I'm too fuckin' mad, you can't do it (Nah)
Fuck with the streets, fuck with my bitch, you can't do it (Nah)
I'm too fuckin' mad, you can't do it (Nah)
I just put the money in your pockets, you can't do it (Nah)
Fuck with my block, I'll fuck your bitch, you can't do it (Nah)
I just put the money in your pockets, you can't do it (Nah)
Fucked up your career, you can't do it (Nah)
We don't fuck around with no thugs, you can't do it (Nah)

[Chorus]
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)
You can't play with us (Fuck with us), we can't be played with (Nah)

[Verse 3]
I'm the man that's on the block, I'm the man on the street
I'm the man that's getting the most money on the street
The man on the block, that's what I tell my men on the street
I'm the man on the street, I'm the man on the block
I'm the man that's getting the most money on the street
The man on the block, that's what I tell my men on the street

[Verse 4]
I'm on the block, I'm on the street
I'm the man on the block, I'm on the street
I'm on the block, I'm on the street
I'm the man on the block, I'm on the street
I'm the man on the street, I'm the man on the block
I'm the man on the street, I'm the man on the street
I'm the man on the block, I'm the man on the street
I'm the man on the block, I'm the man on the street
