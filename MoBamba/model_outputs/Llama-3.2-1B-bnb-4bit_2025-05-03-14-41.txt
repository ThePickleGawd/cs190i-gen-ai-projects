[Verse 1]
As long as I'm alive, I'm gonna keep fighting for my cause
This is my war, so fight for me
So take a stand for me
To live for me
This is my cause
For me to live
But the devil's schemes
I'll stand for me
I will not be denied
It's my right
This is my freedom
I will not be denied
I will not be denied
As long as I'm alive, I'm gonna keep fighting for my cause
As long as I'm alive, I'm gonna keep fighting for my cause
This is my war, so fight for me
So take a stand for me
This is my cause
For me to live
This is my cause
As long as I'm alive, I'm gonna keep fighting for my cause
As long as I'm alive, I'm gonna keep fighting for my cause
This is my war, so fight for me
So take a stand for me
This is my cause
For me to live
This is my cause
As long as I'm alive, I'm gonna keep fighting for my cause
This is my war, so fight for me
So take a stand for me
This is my cause
For me to live
This is my cause
