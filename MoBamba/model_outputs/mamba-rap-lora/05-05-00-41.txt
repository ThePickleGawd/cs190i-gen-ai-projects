[Verse 1]
I'm in a cab (Woah), no one can know
I'm in a crib, no one can see
No one can see me, no one can see me, no one can see me

[Chorus]
I see you when I'm looking in your eyes (I see you)
I see your love in your eyes (I see it)
I see you when I'm looking in your eyes (I see you)
I see your love in your eyes (I see it)
I see you when I'm looking in your eyes (I see you)
I see your love in your eyes (I see it)
I see you when I'm looking in your eyes (I see you)
I see your love in your eyes (I see it)

[Verse 2]
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
I see you in the mirror (I see you in the mirror)
