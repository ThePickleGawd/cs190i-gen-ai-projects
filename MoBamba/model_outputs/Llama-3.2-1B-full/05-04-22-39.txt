[Verse 1]
I got this from my mother, you was my daddy
He said, "Son, sit up, you gotta sit up
You gotta sit up, you gotta sit up
You gotta sit up, you gotta sit up"
I said, "You gotta sit up, you gotta sit up
You gotta sit up, you gotta sit up"
My sister said, "You gotta sit up, you gotta sit up
You gotta sit up, you gotta sit up"
I told her, "You gotta sit up, you gotta sit up
You gotta sit up, you gotta sit up"
I was broke, but you showed me how to flip it
When you showed me how to flip it, when you showed me how to flip it
I was broke, but you showed me how to flip it
When you showed me how to flip it, when you showed me how to flip it
You showed me, you showed me
You showed me, you showed me
You showed me, you showed me
You showed me, you showed me
I was broke, but you showed me how to flip it
When you showed me how to flip it, when you showed me how to flip it
I was broke, but you showed me how to flip it
When you showed me how to flip it, when you showed me how to flip it
You showed me, you showed me
You showed me, you showed me
You showed me, you showed me

[Chorus]
Broke, but you show me how to flip it
When you show me how to flip it, when you show me how to flip it
Broke, but you show me how to flip it
When you show me how to flip it, when you show me how to flip it
Broke, but you show me how to flip it
When you show me how to flip it, when you show me how to flip it
Broke, but you show me how to flip it
When you show me how to flip it, when you show me how to flip it

[Verse 2]
When you was a kid, I used to read you every night
I even got your picture on the wall when I flipped through the page
I was broke, but you showed me how to flip it
When you turned up, I turned up, I had the perfect scheme
You was out here tryna make a nigga strip, I was out here tryna make a G
You got mad, I got rich, you cut me, I cut you, she cut me
You told me, "Cut me," I cut you, "Cut me"
When we got the issues, you were perfect in every way
I could tell you're not cut like that, but you wanna cut me
When I said that, I didn't mean that
When I said, "I don't mean that," girl, I meant that

[Verse 3]
I'm out here tryna make a nigga flip, but I don't think that's your kind of people
I'm the type of nigga make the preacher man's ass get the most attention
I ain't no preacher man
I'm the nigga that make the church's ass get the most attention
I ain't no preacher man
But I'm the nigga that make the church's ass get the most attention
I ain't no preacher man
I'm the nigga that make the church's ass get the most attention
I ain't no preacher man
But I'm the nigga that make the church's ass get the most attention
I ain't no preacher man
'Cause I'm the nigga that make the church's ass get the most attention

[Outro]
I was broke, but you showed me how to flip it
When you showed me how to flip it, when you show me how to flip it
I was broke, but you showed me how to flip it
When you showed me how to flip it, when you show me how to flip it
Broke, but you show me how to flip it
When you show me how to flip it, when you show me how to flip it
I was broke, but you showed me how to flip it
When you showed me how to flip it, when you show me how to flip it
You showed me, you showed me
