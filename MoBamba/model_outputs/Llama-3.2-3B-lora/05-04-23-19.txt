[Verse 1]
My girl wanna know why I can't commit, so I put a ring on it
And when I put it on, she just stare at it, so I take it off and put it in my pocket
When she look into my eyes, she know that's not it, she know that's not it
She want me to confess it, so I confess it
That's a new Patek Phillipe, I don't wear the same watch every day
I'm in love with my girl, I don't want no hoes in my day
When I see you walk by, I get horny, don't give me no eyes
I wanna kiss you in the street, tell me how your day been
I don't know how to speak on it, just want to be yourself with me
I just want to be myself with you, I just wanna love with you
How we gonna be together when you got a lot of other hoes?
I ain't no saint, I'm just a sinner saved by grace
You ain't got no faith, you can't believe in me, girl
You don't wanna hear what I have to say, you just wanna make me lose my mind
I wanna tell you that you make me lose my mind
I wanna tell you that you make me lose my mind
I wanna tell you that you make me lose my mind

[Chorus]
You don't wanna hear what I have to say
But you just wanna make me lose my mind
You don't wanna hear what I have to say
But you just wanna make me lose my mind
You don't wanna hear what I have to say
But you just wanna make me lose my mind
You don't wanna hear what I have to say
But you just wanna make me lose my mind
You don't wanna hear what I have to say
But you just wanna make me lose my mind

[Verse 2]
My girl wanna know why I can't commit, so I put a ring on it
And when she put it on, she stare at it, so I take it off and put it in my pocket
When she look into my eyes, she know that's not it, she know that's not it
She want me to confess it, so I confess it
I've been tryna tell you how I feel, I put a ring on it, it was real
I put a ring on it, it was real, I was trying to tell you how I feel
And I'm trying to tell you how I feel
I don't wanna talk about it, I'm in love with my girl
I don't want no hoes in my phone, so I delete all your number
When I see you walk by, I get horny, don't give me no eyes
I wanna kiss you in the street, tell me how your day been
I don't know how to speak on it, just want to be yourself with me
I just wanna be myself with you, I just wanna love with you
How we gonna be together when you got a lot of other hoes?
I ain't no saint, I'm just a sinner saved by grace
You ain't got no faith, you can't believe in me, girl
You don't wanna hear what I have to say, you just wanna make me lose my mind
I wanna tell you that you make me lose my mind
I wanna tell you that you make me lose my mind
I wanna tell you that you make me lose my mind
I wanna tell you that you make me lose my mind

[Chorus]
You don't wanna hear what I have to say
But you just wanna make me lose my mind
You don't wanna hear what I have to say
But you just wanna make me lose my mind
You don't wanna hear what I have to say
But you just wanna make me lose my mind
You don't wanna hear what I have to say
But you just wanna make me lose my mind
You don't wanna hear what I have to say
But you just wanna make me lose my mind
You don't wanna hear what I have to say
But you just wanna make me lose my mind

[Verse 3]
You don't wanna hear what I have to say

You don't wanna hear what I have to say
