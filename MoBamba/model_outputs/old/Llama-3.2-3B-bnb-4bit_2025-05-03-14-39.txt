[Verse 1]
All the girls are chasing after the boys
They're the first to smile, the first to go
But they never seem to be the ones to see the show
[Verse 2]
I was a young boy chasing after the girls
They were the ones to smile, the ones to go
But they never seemed to be the ones to see the show
[Verse 3]
I was a man, who chased after the women
The ladies were the ones to smile, the ladies were the ones to go
But they never seemed to be the ones to see the show
Chorus]
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
[Verse 4]
I'm a man who is chasing after the girls
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
Verse 1]
I'm a man who's chasing after the women
The ladies are the ones to smile, the ladies are the ones to go
But they never seemed to be the ones to see the show
[Verse 5]
I'm a man who is chasing after the girls
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
Chorus]
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
I ain't afraid of no ghosts and spirits
