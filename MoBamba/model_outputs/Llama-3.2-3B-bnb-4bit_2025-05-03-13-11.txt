[Verse 1]
GloRilla, I'm in the city with the shit on fleek
They gon' give me a million for this single
You know I can't miss, I don't miss, I don't lose
I'm with a bad bitch, I ain't got no good luck
I got my bad bitch in the car, she with me
And she just told me, "I love you, I need you"
And I just said, "Shh, shut up and drive, ho"
But I can't help it, I need her too
She been in the trenches for so long
She was gettin' food stamps, and a little bit of corn
That bitch ain't tryna eat no more
I'm tryna take her to the city, I just wanna take her home
To the crib, I'm tryna give her that
To the club, I'm tryna give her that
She told me she done fell in love with me
You know that shit is real to me
It ain't nothin' that I won't do for her
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I can't lie, I been tryna find someone that I can grow old with
I don't wanna see her cry, I don't wanna see her cry
She ain't been nothin' but down to earth
She been tryna hold on to her pride
She been tryna keep it together
But when we fuck it's the best that I ever had
She just told me that she ain't never been fucked up
She been in the trenches, but she ain't never been broke
She been up in that bitch, she ain't never been lonely
And she just told me she need me in her life
She don't wanna be alone in the dark
She need me to show her that light
She need me to show her that bright
I'll show her that love, I'll show her that light
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been tryna, I've been tryna
I've been tryna, I've been tryna
I've been tryna, I've been tryna
I've been tryna show her my life (Show her my life)
I've been tryna, I've been tryna
I've been tryna, I've been tryna
I've been tryna, I've been tryna
I've been tryna show her my life (Show her my life)

[Chorus]
I told her that I need her in my life
I told her that I need her in my life
Told her that I need her in my life
I told her that I need her in my life
Told her that I need her in my life
I told her that I need her in my life
Told her that I need her in my life
I told her that I need her in my life
I told her that I need her in my life
Told her that I need her in my life
Told her that I need her in my life
Told her that I need her in my life
I told her that I need her in my life
Told her that I need her in my life

[Outro]
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her my life
I'm tryna show her my side, I'm tryna show her
