[Verse 1]
I’m sick of my shit
Don’t matter where we go
I’m sick of your shit
Don’t matter who we’re with
I’m sick of our shit
Don’t matter who you are

[Chorus]
I’m sick of the noise
I’m sick of the lies
I’m sick of the shit
I’m sick of the same old shit

[Verse 2]
I’m sick of the life
I’m sick of my mind
I’m sick of the lies
I’m sick of the same old shit

[Chorus]
I’m sick of the noise
I’m sick of the lies
I’m sick of the shit
I’m sick of the same old shit

[Verse 3]
I’m sick of our shit
I’m sick of you
I’m sick of this bullshit
I’m sick of my mind

[Chorus]
I’m sick of the noise
I’m sick of the lies
I’m sick of the shit
I’m sick of the same old shit

[Bridge]
You’re all the same, you’re all the same
All these lies
And I’m sick of the same old shit

[Chorus]
I’m sick of the noise
I’m sick of the lies
I’m sick of the shit
I’m sick of the same old shit
